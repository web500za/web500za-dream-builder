          I've been hooked on blending technology and creativity for as far back as I can remember.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brand-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Fast forward 20 years from when the photo above was taken, and I'm now working for an industry-leading Cybersecurity company, pursuing a way to make my technical background meaningful.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brand-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This career path has shown me the importance of things being well-built and air-tight. What's more meaningful than bringing that value to small businesses? A fortune 500 pedigree to the barber down the road.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brand-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
          To be blunt, I believe small businesses are what will stop money from leaving our country and start keeping our money circulating locally to feed back into our communities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-brand-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My goal is to strengthen local businesses, in hopes of rekindling the sense of community from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000'sâ€”a spirit that the modern marketplace and modern neighborhood is sorely missing.
        </p>

          If you believe community is the most important thing and want to pursue this together, then the button below is your next step.
